# Rocket
A simple, lightweight interpreted programming language.<br>
# Requirements<br>
Lua - You need to have Lua installed on your system as the interpreter is written in Lua.<br><br>
# Installing Rocket<br>
To install Rocket, first download the source code from the releases page,<br>
Once it's downloaded, extract the compressed folder and extract the `rocket.lua` file.<br>
If you're on a Unix-like OS, it is recommended you add a shebang to `/usr/bin/lua` at the top of the file and move it to `/usr/bin` for easy execution.<br>
If you're on Windows, you can run Rocket manually with `lua rocket.lua <your file (optional)>`.<br><br>
