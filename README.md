# Rocket
A simple interpreted scripting language.<br>
# Requirements<br>
Lua - You need to have Lua installed on your system as the interpreter is written in Lua.<br><br>
# Running a file<br>
The preferred file extension for Rocket files is .rocket, however any extension you fancy will work.<br>
If you're on a Linux or MacOS system, it is recommended that you add a shebang to the top of the file and move it to your `/usr/bin` directory for easy execution.<br>
To open a Rocket file, type `lua ascript.lua <your file>`<br>
To open the Rocket command line, type `lua ascript.lua`<br>
